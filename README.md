### Sonic the Hedgehog in DOOM: Legacy Edition is a Sonic the Hedgehog gameplay mod for DOOM, based on [Sonic: Lock & Load](https://github.com/sonic-lockandload/sonic-lockandload).

Unlike its big brother, StHiD: Legacy is primarily a gameplay-only experience intended to be played with regular DOOM, or, optionally, your favourite map packs.

Also different is the version naming systems. S:L&L versions have their own version numbers, e.g. v1.3.3, v1.4, but StHiD: Legacy uses dates, like 2023-04-10.

The reason for this is that this project is less important than Sonic: Lock & Load, and so more updates can be pushed out, and I don't have to keep coming up for version numbers, which means less stress for me.

To play an unstable version of StHiD: Legacy, use `git clone` to clone it to your computer, and open the cloned repo with GZDoom, like you would with a WAD or PK3. You can update with `git pull`.

Unstable versions are recommended if you want to try the latest stuff and you don't care much about waiting for the next release.
